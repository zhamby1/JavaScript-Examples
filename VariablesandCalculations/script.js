//Comments are notes to self and do not run or activate like actual code
//Javascript is an actual programming language that can be used to create interactive web pages
//Javascript does the same things that a language like Python does

//variables
//variables store date that can be used later
//variables are similar to variables in algebra
// x = 6

//variables are the nouns of the programming world

//variables are declared with the let keyword
//rules for naming variables.. they cannot start with a number, they cannot have spaces
//use underscores for spaces or CamelCase

let first_number = 6  // a line of code is called a statement
let second_number = 5
//we can use variables in calculations and call other variables to be part of the calculation
let sum = first_number + second_number
//if we want to display something we have two option
//one is console.log() which will display the output in the console
//the console is a tool that developers use to see what is happening in the code
//if I want the user of my website to see the output I would use alert()
//alert and console.log are functions
//functions are like verbs in programming
//you can make your own functions or use functions that are built into the language
//to use a fucntion you need to call it and use parentheses
console.log(sum)
//variables also have types
//types are the categories of data that variables can hold
//there are two types of numbers in Javascript
//integers and floats
//integers are whole numbers
//floats are numbers with decimals
//javescript is a loosely/weakly typed language
//this means that the type of the variable can change and you do not have declare it
let x = 7; //integer
let y = 7.5; //float
let sum2 = x + y;
//console.log is a function that takes in a string and displays it in the console
//when we stick a variable in the parentheses of a function we call this an argument.
//the argument is the data the function takes in and use/calculates/transforms
console.log(sum2)

//strings are another type of variable
//strings are text
//strings are always in quotes
let first_name = "John";
console.log(first_name)
//strings can be added together
//this is called concatenation
let last_name = "Doe";
console.log(first_name + " " + last_name)
//we can use +, -, *, /, ** to do math
let product = x * y;
console.log(product)
let division = x / y;
console.log(division)
let exponent = x ** y;
console.log(exponent)
let difference = x - y;
console.log(difference)
